# Chicken Stock (brown)

A brown chicken stock (apparently more flavourful) for using in other recipes.

## Rating:
😋

# INGREDIENTS

**Meat**

  - 1lb of chicken feet
  - ~1 medium ziplock full of chicken bone scraps
  - 1 small pack of chicen wings (reduced/clearance from Save On Foods)
  - 1 roasted chicken carcass (from the chicken in a bag from Save On Foods - most of the meat removed)
  - Random bacon fat scraps

**Mirepoix**

  - 1 leek
  - 1 onion
  - 1 garlic head
  - a few (small) carrots
  - 2 celery stalks

# GOOD TO KNOW

Apparently only root vegetables should be kept as scraps. Definitely no greens like broccoli that will add a bitter taste.

Clean carrot peel is fine.

Garlic/onion peel is ok apparently (but may result in a darker stock).

Chicken wings are apparently the best of both worlds for both body and flavour of the final stock. However chicken breast may result in a tastier stock. Chicken feet add a lot of collagen.

# OBSERVATIONS

**First batch**
- The first batch of stock I made was very gelatinous. This was approx 1.6kg of chicken scraps, including 1lb of chicken feet.
- I don't remember much 'scum' floating on the top of the stock.
- I don't recall a lot of fat on the top at the end.

**Second batch**
- The second batch of chicken stock I made had more fat floating on the top BUT I think this is due to me pouring in the mirepoix to the stock pot with the oil it cooked in (as I didn't want to lose any extra flavour after also browning the raw chicken bones in it).
- I also broke up the meat off the bone after roasting to add to the stock (not sure if that makes any difference for flavour or composition).
- I had approximately 2.7kg of chicken scraps (+ feet, drumsticks and wings), but chicken wings were again ~1lb. I think I should've added another pack of chicken feet for more gelatinous. Also, this time I cut the toenails off the chicken feet (again, don't know how much difference this makes to the end result).

# NOTES FOR FUTURE

**Chicken Feet**
For a very gelatinous stock I *think* chicken feet should make up 1/4-1/3 of the chicken 'scraps' by weight.

**Volume**
Volume of the stock will only be a little under the volume of water.
For water I have been adding *2x + 1 = litres* of water added, where *x* is the weight in kg of chicken scraps.

# DIRECTIONS

 1. Chop fairly small (but we don't care too much) all of the mirepoix. I kept the carrot ends, some peel, onion skin, etc. 
 1. When ready to roast put the mirepoix in a large skillet (or roasting tray) and even spread across the bottom for even coverage with a generous drizzle of olive oil.
 1. Add *raw* chicken scraps over the top (but not the feet).
 1. Roast for ~1 hour @375F until golden. May want to give things a shake/turn over halfway through. Your house should be pleasantly fragrant.
 1. Once out of the oven and cooled slightly separate the chicken/scraps from the mirepoix. Weigh the chicken scraps.
 1. In a deep large pot (stainless steel pot) add a generous drizzle of olive oil, heat to medium and spread chicken feet across the bottom.
 1. Brown the chicken feet for ~5 minutes until golden on both sides.
 1. Use a generous splash of white wine to deglaze the bottom of the pan and scrape up all the fond *but keep it in the pan*.
 1. Add *all* of the rest of the chicken scraps into the big pot.
 1. You should know the approximate weight of all of the chicken scraps by this point. Double the weight for the approximate amount of water to use. So for 1.6kg of chicken scraps, you'll want at least 3L of water.
 1. Use your cooking implements (wooden spoon for me) to flatten the chicken scraps as best as possible, then cover with ~3L of water to start. If a lot of the chicken starts floating or poking out of the top then add more water. I think I added 4L in total.
 1. Keep an eye on the temperature of the water. You don't want it to boil for long, so once it's bubbling reduce it to a low simmer. For me I went from a 5/9 (halfway on the temp dial) down to a 2-2.5. There's a lot of jelly/fat/misc. on the top so it's gently bubbling under that surface.
 1. Set a timer for 2 hours.
 1. Periodically check back to see how the water is doing and smell it. *Don't touch it*. It's not a soup, so leave it alone. I personally haven't skimmed anything off the top of it, but if you want to, just use a ladle and do a bit from the side. *I don't think I added enough water to be able to skim, but that's ok*
 1. After 2 hours add all the mirepoix back in and let it gently simmer for another hour or so. *some people on the internet have said that boiling their veg for the whole time results in a more bitter stock*
 1. Strain the big lumps out with a colander **into a big bowl or something, KEEP THE STOCK, don't throw it away**. 
 1. Use a sieve lined with cheesecloth (or kitchen towel?) to strain for a second time and get the smaller bits out.
 1. Pour into waterever containers you want. If using it in the next week or so the fridge should be fine, otherwise ice cube trays and freeze it.
