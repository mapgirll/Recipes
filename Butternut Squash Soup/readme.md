# INGREDIENTS

  - 1.5kg butternut squash, peeled, cubed (this was 2 normal sized ones)
  - 2 onion + 2-3 shallots (that's what I had)
  - 3 garlic cloves
  - 3 fresno chilli peppers (I wouldn't exceed this)
  - 1250ml stock (I used ~900ml veg stock from bouillon cubes and ~350ml homemade chicken stock)
  - 6 tbsp creme fraiche (Whole Foods sells it)
  - butter and olive oil

# GOOD TO KNOW

Keep 1/4 of the chilli peppers separate (for serving).

A nice fresh baguette and butter will be yummy to serve with.

# DIRECTIONS

 1. Chop the butternut squash in half, scoop out the seeds with a spoon, peel with a peeler, then chop into roughly even sized cubes. The smaller the better.
 1. When ready to roast put the butternut squash in a large skillet (or roasting tray) and even spread across the bottom for even coverage with a generous drizzle of olive oil. Roast at ~400F for at least 30 minutes. Turn regularly after 20 minutes and check. When butternut squash is ready a fork will easily go through it. When it's ready, remove chunks from the roasting pan and add them to the magic bullet blender in batches to blitz with stock.
 1. Make the stock, leave on the stove top so it's warm.

> [!WARNING]
> This soup is good but lacking **something**. We think that might be acid.
> Once the onions, garlic and chilli are soft, add in 1tbsp of ACV as an experiment.

 1. Dice and chop up the garlic, onion and chillis. Add them to a dutch oven or other large pan on a low heat for 20-30 minutes until soft. This is where you'll use some butter and oil. When soft, add them ALL to nutribullet with some stock. Blend up until smooth then add back to the dutch oven.
 1. Add blended butternut squash + stock batches to the dutch oven when they're ready. This might be a longer process depending on how long it takes for all the butternut squash to be cooked.
 1. Once it's all done (or once at least half the butternut squash has been added) taste the soup and add MSG and salt to taste.
 1. Once it's all in the pan add 6tbsp of creme fraiche and mix in.
 1. To serve, add a dollop of creme fraiche and garnish with the remaining chilli.
