# Bacon mushroom risotto

## Rating:
😋😋😋😋😋

# INGREDIENTS

  - 50g porcini mushrooms (dried)
  - 1.3l chicken stock
  - 250g mushrooms (cremini preferably) sliced
  - 8 rashers of bacon / 300g lean bacon (honestly just put however much you want in)
  - 50g butter
  - 1 onion or 3 shallots
  - 300g risotto rice (arborio)
  - 175ml white wine
  - 2 garlic cloves (or more if you want)
  - 2 chicken breasts, chopped up small-ish, cooked

# GOOD TO KNOW

Wear gloves for prepping the onions and garlic to avoid stinky fingers.

Do this in a dutch oven or something similar that's suitably sized. When my new Staub saucier-type pan comes in I will use that instead of a dutch oven.

# INSTRUCTIONS

 1. Soak dried mushrooms in 500ml boiling water for 20 minutes. 
 1. Cut up bacon into smaller chunks (think panchetta cubes) and fry the bacon in half of the butter.
 1. Finely chop garlic and onions, and add to the bacon.
 1. Add sliced mushrooms once the onions have softened.
 1. Add soaked mushrooms (before adding you can chop them up smaller once rehydrated).
 1. Season with salt and pepper.
 1. Add 300g of rice and stir in.
 1. Add wine to simmer off/deglaze the bottom of the pan.
 1. Add 1/4 of the stock at a time. Let it simmer and stiry regularly/constantly. This will take a while, you're waiting for the rice to absorb up the stock. 
 1. Once the stock is mostly absorbed add another 1/4 of stock. Repeat this process until nearly all of the stock has been added and the rice is creamy, plump, tender.
 1. At this point at the remaining stock and the rest of the butter. Stir in until melted.
 1. Enjoy.
