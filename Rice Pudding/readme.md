# Rice Pudding

## Rating:
😋😋😋😋

# INGREDIENTS

  - 80g pudding/arborio rice
  - 74g sugar
  - 900ml 2% milk
  - 275ml clotted cream
  - splash of vanilla extract

# GOOD TO KNOW

Add more sugar for a bit more sweetness, and add more vanilla if you want Jon to enjoy it.

# INSTRUCTIONS

 1. Preheat oven to 310F.
 1. In a deep, glass baking dish add sugar, rice and liquids.
 1. Give it a mix and put it in the oven for 30 minutes.
 1. Add a blob of unsaltede butter.
 1. Back in oven for 2 hours. The butter will add a natural 'lid' over the top of the rice pudding. Keep an eye on it in case it gets too clumpy and not liquidy enough.
