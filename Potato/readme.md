# Potato

A combination of a variety of potato recipes.

## Potato Wedges

### INGREDIENTS

  - Potato... duh (russet potatoes are a solid choice in North America for roasting and fries etc.)
  - Seasonings of choice... I recommend paprika and oregano (and salt)

### GOOD TO KNOW

If you're pre-prepping the potatoes keep them submerged in water until you're ready to cook.

Boil potatoes from **cold** so the starchy food cooks properly and doesn't get 'shocked' by boiling water and just overcook the outside.

### INSTRUCTIONS

 1. Chop potatoes into wedges, roughly equal sizes so they cook equally.
 1. Boil potatoes *from cold*. When the water is boiling set a timer for about 5 minutes so you can kind of put a knife through them but there's some resistance and they're not overdone.
 1. Drain into colander and forget about them for a bit. (Ideally this is so they are actually dry for the next step and not damp). Fluff them up a bit if you want by knocking them around in the colander (but not too violently).
 1. Put foil in the air fryer as a lining on the bottom, then add tatties and liberally spray with oil and coat in seasonings. Cook in the air fryer for ~12 minutes on roast @360F. Once 'done', re-spray, season and salt and put back in ~10 minutes on roast @360F. Adjust time depending on desired crispiness.
 1. Add more salt to taste.
