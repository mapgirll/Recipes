  - 1/4 tsp cumin
  - 1/4 tsp mustard powder

  - 1.5 cup ketchup
  - 1/2 cup brown sugar

# GOOD TO KNOW

The brisket that you use will make a difference. Cooking it in the oven is superior to the instant pot.

# INSTRUCTIONS

 1. Mix rub ingredients together and rub all over the brisket. *Wear gloves to avoid gross hands*
 1. Leave brisket while you make the sauce.
 1. Preheat oven to 320F.
 1. Mix all sauce ingredients together in a dutch oven (or whatever you're going to cook the brisket in). Once they're mixed well you can start to simmer the sauce. If adding brisket, continue. If not, simmer and cook until thickens. The sauce will also thicken as it cools and comes off the heat.
 1. Add 2 cups of water to the sauce in the dutch oven and mix well.
 1. Add the brisket so that it's mostly submerged (or fully if you can).
 1. Cook for 4 hours in the oven, basting every hour or so.
 1. After 4 hours, cook uncovered for 30 minutes.
 1. Optional: broil to finish off the brisket.
 1. Serve with the bbq sauce (and keep/store the leftover sauce).
