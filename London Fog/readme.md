# London Fog (Jen style)

Jen does not like tea or coffee unless it doesn't taste like tea or coffee, so this is a sweet London Fog.

## Rating:
😋😋😋😋

# INGREDIENTS

**London Fog**

  - 3-4 tea bags (David's tea cream of Earl Grey is my current teabags)
  - Vanilla syrup
  - Lavender syrup
  - Milk (3% dairyland protein milk is my go-to)

# GOOD TO KNOW

Jen does not like watery tea, so needs enough teabags to offset that, but also enough syrup and milk to make it not taste too much like tea. *Don't ask*.

# INSTRUCTIONS

> ⚠️
> I followed the instructions/ratios for a coffee latte, so depending on how much milk you're able to steam you may need to adjust the water.

 1. Boil kettle.
 1. Put 3-4 teabags in a large mug. 
 1. When kettle is boiled, put mug on a scale and pour ~110ml of boiling hot water into mug. Put aside for a bit to steep.
 1. While the teabags are teabagging, make the milk. Pour the maximum amount of milk in the milk steamer jug (I think for our Breville machine it's about ~1 cup) and steam/froth/foam it up.
 1. If you are using a nice milk steamer have a warm, wet cloth ready to wipe down the steam wand immediately otherwise Jon will tell you off.
 1. Add syrup into the mug with tea bags. 2tbsp of lavender syrup (random brand from Winners) and 3 pumps of vanilla syrup (Torani or Monin are the only acceptable syrups).
 1. Stir (or if you're lazy just swish the teabags around in the mug to mix the syrup) and then pour the steamed milk on top.
 1. Enjoy.

 > ⚠️
> If you've never steamed milk before, look up the techniques. You want to balance foam creation with foam density. Ideally you will be a fair amount of foam (not too much) and it will be 'strong'... kind of like stiff peaks for meringue. The steam wand nozzle should be at an angle in the jug and be just below the surface of the milk.
