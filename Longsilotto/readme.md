# INGREDIENTS

  - 1-2 packs of longanisa, depending on how much sausage you want. I used 2 packs of sweet longanisa (2x375g) but next time I'd like to try one sweet one spicy.
  - 1 small onion, chopped small
  - 2-3 cloves of garlic, chopped really small (or minced)
  - 1.2L of [chicken stock](../Chicken Stock/readme.md)
  - 300g arborio rice
  - 100g frozen peas
  - 60g or parmesan (I honestly just generously eyeballed this)
  - 2 tbsp vinegar (I used red wine vinegar)
  - 1 tsp soy sauce (could try patis instead)

# GOOD TO KNOW

Wear gloves for prepping the onions and garlic to avoid stinky fingers.

# INSTRUCTIONS

 1. Cook longanisa per instructions. Once the longanisa is frying it's own oil add the finely chopped garlic and onions. I also took this time to cut all of the longanisa in half with scissors while the onion and garlic is softening.
 1. Add the arborio rice to the pan. Give it a good stir so that the oils and flavour fully coat the rice.
 1. Add the vinegar and stir as it evaporates.
 1. Start heating the stock on the stove so it's not going into the longsilotto cold.
 1. Add 1-2 ladles worth of stock to the rice in the pan and keep stirring as it (slowly) starts to get absorbed. I have this on a medium heat so it's gently simmering.
 1. When stock levels reduce in the pan, top it up one ladel and at a time. It is important to do this slowly and keep stirring so that the arborio rice releases starch as it plumps it and gives it the creamy texture.
 1. Keep going until you're at your last ladel or so of stock to add. This is where I added the tsp of soy sauce to the remaining stock before stirring it in.
 1. Once it's stirred in and most of the stock is absorbed, add in the parmesan (to taste) and keep stirring. The parmesan will melt into it and make it kind of stringy if you look closely.
 1. Add the peas (still frozen) and keep stirring.
 1. Turn the heat off and keep stirring. There should be no loose liquid at this time and the risotto should be plump, creamy and sweet.
 1. Serve with an egg (cooked to your liking) for breakfast.
 1. Mmmm, sarap an sarap.
