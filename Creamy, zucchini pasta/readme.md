# Creamy Z'ini Pasta

## Rating:
😋😋😋😋😋

# INGREDIENTS

  - 1-3 mushrooms, sliced fairly thin (but not too thin)
  - 1-2 garlic cloves, finely diced
  - 1 large shallot (or a few small ones)
  - 55-75g bow pasta (or any pasta really, but flat pasta is better, so not penne)
  - 1 well-endowed zucchini 'peeled' into thin slices
  - 2-4 slices of prosciutto (or ham, or bacon, etc.) ripped up into smaller pieces
  - cream of some kind. Table cream or double cream or anything with a similar or higher fat %
  - Parmesan if you want to finish

# GOOD TO KNOW

Wear gloves for prepping the onions and garlic to avoid stinky fingers.

# INSTRUCTIONS

 1. Finely chop garlic and onions.
 1. Peel zucchini.
 1. Chop mushrooms.
 1. Boil pasta in a saucepan. You only want enough water to just cover the pasta. When the water is nearly all gone it should be done. Don't let the pasta burn.
 1. On a low/medium heat cook the garlic/shallots in oil or butter. You'll want a large wide pan for this, with decent sides (but not too tall).
 1. After ~5 minutes when they're translucent or softened, add the mushrooms.
 1. When the mushrooms are softer add the ham.
 1. Add the zucchini on top. It'll take over most of the pan and look like a lot but they will get smaller. Keep stirring until the zucchini is soft but not mushy.
 1. Drain the pasta and add into the pan.
 1. Pour cream on top. You want enough to generously coat all of the ingredients, but not too much that it becomes soupy.
