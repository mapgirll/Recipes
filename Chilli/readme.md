## Rating:
😋😋😋😋😋

# INGREDIENTS

  - A large pack of minced (ground) beef from Costco (~2kg)
  - 3 long sweet peppers (the long pointy ones)
  - 6+ garlic cloves (more the better)
  - 3 average sized yellow/medium onions
  - 2 large tins of diced tomatos (796ml)
  - 6 bouillon cubes/packets
  - 1 tube of 2x concentrate tomato paste
  - 5 packets of chilli seasoning (we mixed old el paso and club house)
  - 1 tin of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
  - 2 tins of red kidney beans (the bigger tins)
  - 1 tin white kidney beans


# GOOD TO KNOW

The chipotle peppers taste quite hot out of the tin, but actually in the chilli they didn't any much spice at all.

Wear gloves for prepping the onions and garlic to avoid stinky fingers.

# INSTRUCTIONS

 1. Finely chop garlic and onions.
 1. Finely chop peppers.
 1. Finely-ish chop up the chipotle peppers from the tin.
 1. In a large stainless steel pan on low/medium heat melt a large blob of butter (use common sense for how much - you can always add more) and add the onions and garlic. Keep mixing for a few minutes on a low heat until the onions start to get translucent.
 1. Add the peppers and keep mixing on a low heat.
 1. Start adding beef a bit at a time (~500g if your pot is big). You can also use another pan to brown the rest of hte beef in parallel. You'll want a med-high heat to brown the beef.
 1. While the beef is cooking add the chilli powders/spice mixes and all of the tomato paste. Keep stirring until it's mixed well. Keep scraping the bottom of the pan so it doesn't get burnt on.
 1. Once it's well combined add 3.5 cups of water (originally 4.5 but the tomatos add a lot of liquid). Again, ensure it's not burnt onto the bottom. The water should help loosen anything.
 1. Add the chipotle peppers, tomato, and beans (drained and rinsed using a colander).
 1. Keep stirring and taste the chilli as you go. Don't salt until nearer the end as the chilli should reduce and the flavour get better over time.
 1. Leave it covered on low-ish heat for a few hours. Stir periodically and loosen food from the bottom of the pan.
